== Steps to follow when add or update a layer
	- The following machines are involved:
		- M: master vector tile server(currently 221)
		- Si: slave vector tile servers(currently 216)
		- L: local TileService machine
		- Pi: Published TileService machines which provide online tile service (currently 184,186,188,190)
	- Both datasets and stylesets shall first be deployed on M, then copied onto Si
	- Term: layerstring = the string generated by running `install.sh` in the styleset folder
	- Use the following steps to add or update a layer (any change in styleset is an update)
		- Get databases ready on all vector tile servers
		- On M
            - block traffic from Pi
            - stop renderd, clear cache
            - install new styleset and test
            - fill cache
            - enable traffic from Pi
        - On Si, block traffic from Pi
		- On Pi, update web.config to use new layerstring
		- On Si
            - stop renderd, clear cache
            - copy new styleset from M
            - fill cache
            - enable traffic from Pi
		- At last, use `calc_group_range.py` to generate new ranges and update legendlayer document
