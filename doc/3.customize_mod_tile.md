# How to customize mod_tile

---
### How to change size of metatile
- Edit `includes/renderd_config.h`, change `#define METATILE (8)` to 2/4/8/16 (any number which is a power of 2)
- Compile and install

### How to enable Parameterization (P14N for short) in mod_tile
- The P14N in mod_tile is developed by a guy known as Kai Krueger. Check: http://gis.19327.n5.nabble.com/parameterization-of-mapnik-style-sheets-in-mod-tile-renderd-and-multi-lingual-maps-td5781510.html
- P14N can be enabled seperately for each TileSet. Its purpose is to accept a param from url, and run a customized function to change map behavior with the param, cache generated metatile with param in the file name.
- How to enable P14N: 
    - Open renderd.conf (for example, `/usr/local/etc/renderd.conf`) and find the TileSet you want to enable P14N on (for example, default), add this line: `PARAMETERIZE_STYLE=function_name`
    - Restart both apache and renderd
    - You should be able to visit: http://131.94.133.221/osm_tiles/any_parameter_you_want_to_pass/0/0/0.png
    - A metatile will be generated under: `/var/lib/mod_tile/default/0/.../0.any_parameter_you_want_to_pass.meta`
    - But the param is not used by the program yet.
    - Edit parameterize_style.cpp, add a function called "function_name" to change the map with parameter. Compile and install the modified program.
    - The P14N by default only support parameters of length <= 40, change this limit by editing:
        - mod_tile.c, line 1316: `n = sscanf(r->uri+strlen(tile_config->baseuri),"%40[^/]/%d/%d/%d.%255[a-z]/%10s", parameters,&(cmd->z), &(cmd->x), &(cmd->y), extension, option); `
        - protocal.h: `XMLCONFIG_MAX = new_limit`
